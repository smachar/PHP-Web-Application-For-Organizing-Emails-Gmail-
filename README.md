# PHP Web Application For Organizing Emails(Gmail)

This is a web application that helps Gmail users to organize their emails by simply classifying them automatically into the user predefined boxes. After the user defines his/her set of boxes using multiple criteria, all the incoming emails will be classified according to this set of boxes. Furthermore, the user can see his/her emails in his/her dashboard and sort, navigate and search (advanced) them, but for further functionalities like "replay" and "send email" the user should go to his/her Gmail account.

The objective of this project was to apply all that I've been learning during my program including Programming and Algorithms concepts, Databases Management (ER diagrams and SQL), and of course Web Development and Networking, the idea was to build something even if it's simple but from scratch without using any fancy libraries, just HTML/CSS/JS and PHP, pure web technologies.

In this project, I had the chance to experience using Gmail API, storing JSON data in relational databases, and some fundamental web security concepts such as SQL injection.

### Future work
In the future, I'm planning to apply more advanced unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering to automatically group similar emails in one box, so the user doesn't have to create those boxes manually, for example, all emails related to education are automatically stored in the "Education" box.
